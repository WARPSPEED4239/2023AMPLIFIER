# TO DO ON SATURDAY

Do 1 and 2 first then choose an option

> 1. Add weights to charge station(ramp). Talk to Kraeker, 
he know the exact amount you need for each side and
exactly where to put it.

> 2. Test if the charge station(ramp) is slamming down slower
If it is not talk to Kraaker or Darren if he is still there.

You have a few options for what you can do today.

> Option 1. Talk to teamates and find out how the Intake and Arm work.
After figuring out how it works, figure out how you will map the controllers(talk to the driveteam).
Then, Pre-code the Intake and Arm subsystems and Commands. (If you finish this option early start Option 2)

> Option 2. Keep working on Auto Balance for autonomous.

> Option 3. (only do this option if you are done with Option 1 and are
really, really stuck on Option 2)
Do a little bit of code academy or if you want you can work
on your own coding project that you are interested in making.
If you choose to do a coding project here is some places for inspiration.

> I would recommend making some sort of utility/tool
that takes in data and does something with it.
I recommend making this not too easy but atleast a little
challenging but something that shouldn't take something more than like 2-3 hours
to code.
